👋 Hi, I’m Luciano. I'm an artist with a passion for exploring the creative possibilities of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

👀 I’m interested in pushing the boundaries of art through AI-powered creations. I believe that combining the creativity of artists with the computational power of AI can lead to innovative and mind-bending artworks.

🌱 I’m currently learning PyTorch and diving into the world of deep learning to harness the potential of AI in my artistic endeavors. While it's not my primary area of expertise, I'm excited about the possibilities it offers.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on groundbreaking art projects that challenge traditional notions of art. I'm seeking enthusiastic collaborators who share my passion for AI-driven art and are eager to explore new frontiers together.
